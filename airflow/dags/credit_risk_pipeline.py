"""Credit-Risk Cockpit — batch pipeline (C1.7).

    ingest (Kaggle -> GCS -> BigQuery)  ->  dbt run + dbt test  (via Cosmos)

Cosmos renders EACH dbt model as its own Airflow task (with its tests right after),
so the DAG mirrors the dbt lineage instead of hiding it behind a single
`BashOperator dbt run`. The dbt project and the ingest script are bind-mounted from
the repo (see docker-compose.override.yml) — one source of truth, no duplication.

Honest framing: on the static LendingClub snapshot this batch runs once. It is written
for incremental ingestion (schedule it @daily in production) and included as a
production-readiness demonstration.

Run it locally: `cd airflow && astro dev start` (needs Docker + the Astro CLI), then
trigger `credit_risk_pipeline` from the Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080.
